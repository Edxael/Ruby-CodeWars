This repo have the answers for the site "www.codewars.com", when I do one and put the answer on the repository to practice Git.

quick location
cd ~/Dropbox/00-git/05-ruby-codewars

01 -Create folder on PC, and create a ReadMe file on that folder 

02 -Create a new repository on GitHub.com

03 -Open Terminal then CD .. to the folder previusly created and execute following commands:
		$ git init
		$ git add *
		$ git remote add origin https://github.com/Edxael/JS-Small-Projects.git

04 -Create new folder with files, make changes, when ready to push. 
		$ git status
